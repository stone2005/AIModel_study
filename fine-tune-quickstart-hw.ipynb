I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

This is D grade frozen cheap supply, sold as seafood. The only way this can be considered seafood, is if the pig was a surfer, or ate crab legs and shrimp cakes every day of its sad life, waiting to have its turd-cutter transformed into sliced overpriced greasy lies.\\n\\n2. Spicey Buffalo Wings. Yes, it chicken...9 of 12 wings were freezer-burned LEGS, not wings. The chewiness, freezer burn, and overall \\\"wet skin\\\" texture of the heat lamp cooked wings was more like a zombie chew toy, than a delicious chicken wing. Yuck.\\n\\n3.Antipasto...Romain lettuce, sliced CANNED black olives, Sliced Red Tomato, worst provolone I've ever tasted, D-rate salami, and, well, that was it...other than the water-slide water called \\\"Italian Dressing\\\" that came with it. Pepperoncini? Nope. Green olives? Negative. Flavor? Nooooooope!\\n\\n4. Garlic Knots. These dough balls must cheap This crap-shack in operation. Delicious? Nope...but after eating a freezer burned bouquet of bad choices, I guess a near flavorless ball of dough, low grade olive oil (not even 100% olive oil), and flavorless garlic mush, formed into a blown out balloon knot, this became the highlight of our night. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I'M ON VACATION, and after a long day of fun, on our last day, decided to waste $40 on straight-up garbage. I'm looking at a pile of wings, half a disabled salad, and a some pig anus rings. The Garlic Knots were superb though! If superb means lackluster bread nuggets.\\n\\nPs, we drove to get pickup, because delivery was going to be AN HOUR AND A HALF! We're a mile away!

After a recommendation from a good friend we decide to do a late night dinner. We were greeted by an officer of the Phoenix police department before we even got to the front door. Worrisome?! Once we walk through the doors my eardrums were assaulted with extremely loud music. I'm all for setting a mood but the restaurant was packed with all but 3 tables and us. Not the best group of 7 dinner date atmosphere. We had to scream over the \\\"tunes\\\". After waiting for what felt like 20 minutes for our waitress to come over we finally placed our order. I knew the shrimp quesadilla cost $12.99 and the drink was $1.99. High but willing to pay after the waitress said it was a decent plate serving. I also added rice and beans. The meal came out quickly but my white rice was adorned with wrinkly peas and one random Lima bean... Odd. The quesadilla was soggy and there was hardly any shrimp in it. We continually asked for the music to be turned down and we kindly ignored. RUDE! Right before the check came they decided it was a good idea to have a full mariachi band play to all but 9 people. So loud I thought my ears were bleeding. Then the bills come out. We asked to pay separate. No big deal. Then she proceeded to hand out our bills. I looked at the price and nearly fell off my chair. She had added the total of everyone's meals and put a 10% gratuity on it! Not cool!!!! Then I see a charge for $4 for a drink. I asked the waitress what the charge was and she proceeded to tell me that after 9pm the drinks are no longer $1.99. Everyone got water at that same price as well. Never heard of a $4 glass of water. She never mentioned this, nor did it say anything about that on their menu... Pretty petty if you ask me. Now it totally makes sense why there was no one in this place on a Friday night! I'm so disappointed and feel like I have been taken advantage of. I'm a good tipper and usually look past \\\"petty\\\" stuff but this was the worst dining experience I've had. Ever!</td>\n",
